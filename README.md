Steam Server Status library
=========================

How to get it
-------------

The easiest way to get it is via [npm]

    npm install steam-server-status

If you want to run the latest version (i.e. later than the version available
via [npm]) you can clone this repo, then use [npm] to link-install it:

    npm link /path/to/your/clone

Of course, you can just clone this, and manually point at the library itself,
but I really recommend using [npm]!
